        <p>
          The traditional organisation has always had an invisible line running through it. On one side: the people who understand the business — the customers, the workflows, the problems that actually matter. On the other: the people who can build things. For decades, crossing that line required years of technical training. And the cost of the gap between them was paid in every miscommunication, every lost translation between business requirement and technical delivery, every product that arrived six months late and recognisably different from the original intent.
        </p>

        <p>
          That line is fading.
        </p>

        <h2>The Expert Gap and Its Costs</h2>

        <p>
          Most organisations have experienced the frustration in some form. A senior manager with a clear vision of what needs to be built, unable to communicate it precisely enough for an engineering team to execute without significant interpretation. A product idea that survives three rounds of specification, two rounds of scope reduction, and months of development — only to arrive as something the original stakeholder barely recognises.
        </p>

        <p>
          The gap between "the person who understands the problem" and "the person who can build the solution" has always been expensive. Product managers, business analysts, and project managers exist largely to bridge it. Agile ceremonies, user story frameworks, specification documents — all are tools designed to make the gap navigable. None of them close it.
        </p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
          "The value of an idea has never been limited by the idea itself. It has always been limited by the distance between the idea and the people who could build it."
        </div>

        <p>
          The result, over decades, has been an organisational structure where domain expertise and building capability exist in separate silos, connected by an imperfect translation process that introduces delay, distortion, and cost at every handoff. The best analysts, strategists, and domain experts in any organisation have spent significant portions of their careers frustrated by their inability to act directly on what they know.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is Actually Changing</h2>

        <p>
          AI-assisted development tools are doing something that decades of process improvement could not: they are compressing the distance between understanding a problem and being able to create a solution to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This does not mean that everyone is becoming a developer. It means something more subtle and more significant: the floor of what it takes to meaningfully participate in building has dropped substantially. Domain expertise — genuine, hard-won knowledge of a market, a customer, a process — is now more directly convertible into working products than it has ever been.
        </p>

        <p>
          A logistics specialist who understands exactly why current routing software fails can describe the problem in sufficient detail for an AI-assisted development process to produce a working prototype. A financial analyst who sees an inefficiency in how reports are compiled can build a tool to address it — not hypothetically, not by filing a ticket, but practically, in the same week the insight arrives. A customer service leader who knows which workflows cause the most friction can model solutions directly rather than waiting for a development team's next available sprint.
        </p>

        <p>
          This shift has a name in some circles: the "citizen developer." But that term undersells what is happening. Citizen developers in the traditional sense use low-code tools to produce basic automations. What AI-assisted development enables is closer to genuine product creation, driven by people whose primary expertise is not writing software but the domain the software serves.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Means for Different Roles</h2>

        <p>
          The implications ripple through organisations differently depending on where you sit.
        </p>

        <p>
          For <strong>business leaders</strong>, the most immediate implication is that domain expertise in your team is now a more productive asset than it was three years ago. The logistics specialist, the financial analyst, the customer service expert who understands the system better than anyone — these people can now do more with what they know. The question is whether your organisation gives them the tools and permission to act on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          For <strong>technical teams</strong>, the change is equally significant but different in character. The volume of requests that previously required senior developer involvement will shrink. What remains will be more complex, more architecturally interesting, and higher-stakes. The craft of software engineering becomes more demanding at the top, even as the barrier to basic participation drops at the bottom. This is not a threat to engineering roles — it is a redistribution of what engineering effort is spent on.
        </p>

        <p>
          For <strong>product and strategy functions</strong>, the translation role changes. Rather than translating business requirements into technical specifications and managing the communication gap, the job becomes orchestrating iteration — moving quickly between insight, prototype, feedback, and refinement. The loop gets faster, which means the judgment required at each step matters more, not less.
        </p>

        <h2>The Danger of Misreading This Shift</h2>

        <p>
          There is a tempting but wrong interpretation of these changes: that technical expertise is becoming less valuable, that organisations can reduce their investment in engineering, that anyone can now build anything. None of that is accurate.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is changing is not the value of expertise but the distribution of productive capability. <mark class="highlight">Strong engineers working with AI tools are dramatically more productive than they were.</mark> Domain experts with access to AI-assisted tools can now participate in building in ways they previously could not. Both things are true simultaneously, and they reinforce each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          The organisations that will struggle are those that mistake "more people can participate in building" for "fewer people with deep expertise are needed." The organisations that will thrive are those that recognise that genuine expertise — technical or domain — has become more valuable, not less, precisely because it can now be applied more directly and more quickly.
        </p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
          "Expertise is not being devalued. It is being unshackled. The gap between knowing something and being able to act on it is closing."
        </div>

        <h2>What to Do with This Insight</h2>

        <p>
          For business leaders, the practical implication is straightforward: invest in the conditions that allow domain expertise to convert into action.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Give people with deep domain knowledge access to AI-assisted development tools, and the time and permission to experiment with them</li>
          <li>Reduce internal bureaucracy around who is "allowed" to build tools and prototypes — the question should be whether the output is useful, not whether the person who built it has a technical job title</li>
          <li>Measure outcomes rather than credentials — what matters is whether a problem gets solved, not whether it was solved by the team that traditionally owns it</li>
          <li>Build knowledge-sharing practices so that successful experiments propagate across the organisation rather than remaining isolated within a single team's workflow</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The organisations that will look back on this period as a turning point are those that recognised, relatively early, that their best asset was always the expertise of their people — and that the constraint on converting that expertise into value was not the expertise itself, but the tools and permission to act on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those tools now exist. The question is whether you use them.
        </p>
